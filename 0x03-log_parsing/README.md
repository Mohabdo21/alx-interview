# 0x03. Log Parsing

This project is part of the Algorithm Python curriculum. The main objective is to understand and implement the concept of log parsing in Python.

## Concepts Needed:

- **File I/O in Python**: Learn to read from sys.stdin line by line.
- **Signal Handling in Python**: Understand how to handle keyboard interruption (CTRL + C).
- **Data Processing**: Learn to parse strings to extract specific data points and aggregate data to compute summaries.
- **Regular Expressions**: Use regular expressions to validate the format of each line.
- **Dictionaries in Python**: Use dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.
- **Exception Handling**: Handle possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.
