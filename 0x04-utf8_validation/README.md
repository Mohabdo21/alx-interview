# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation

This project is part of the Algorithm Python curriculum. The main objective is to validate whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Concepts Needed:

- **Bitwise Operations in Python**: Learn to manipulate bits in Python, including operations like AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), and shifts (<<, >>).

- **UTF-8 Encoding Scheme**: Understand the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes and the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.

- **Data Representation**: Learn to represent and work with data at the byte level and handle the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.

- **List Manipulation in Python**: Get comfortable with iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.

- **Boolean Logic**: Apply logical operations to make decisions within the program.
