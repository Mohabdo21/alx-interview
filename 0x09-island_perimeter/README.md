# 0x09. Island Perimeter

This project is part of the Algorithm Python curriculum. The main objective is to understand and implement the concept of calculating the perimeter of an island in a grid.

## Concepts Needed:

- **2D Arrays (Matrices)**:

  - Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
  - Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

- **Conditional Logic**:

  - Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

- **Counting Techniques**:

  - Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.

- **Problem-Solving Strategies**:

  - Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

- **Python Programming**:
  - Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
  - Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
