# 0x06. Star Wars API

This project is part of the Algorithm API JavaScript curriculum. The main objective is to understand and implement the concept of interacting with the Star Wars API in JavaScript.

## Concepts Needed:

- **HTTP Requests in JavaScript**: Understand how to make HTTP requests to external services using the request module or alternatives like fetch in Node.js. A Complete Guide to Making HTTP Requests in Node.js can be a useful resource.

- **Working with APIs**: Understand the basics of RESTful APIs and how to interact with them. This includes parsing JSON data returned by APIs. You can learn more about this in Working with APIs in JavaScript.

- **Asynchronous Programming**: Learn to manage asynchronous operations with callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax. This includes handling API response data asynchronously. Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript can provide more insights.

- **Command Line Arguments in Node.js**: Learn to use the process.argv array to access command-line arguments passed to a Node.js script. How to Parse Command Line Arguments in Node.js can be a helpful guide.

- **Array Manipulation and Iteration**: Understand how to iterate over arrays and manipulate data structures to format and display character names. JavaScript Array Methods can be a good starting point.
