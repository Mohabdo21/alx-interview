# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

This project is part of the Alx - SE curriculum of software engineering. The main objective is to understand and implement the concepts of Pascal's Triangle in Python.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what Pascal's Triangle is and how it is generated.
- Learn how to use lists and list comprehensions to create, access, modify, and iterate over lists, especially for generating rows of Pascal’s Triangle.
- Know how to define and call functions, pass parameters and return values, particularly how to return a list of lists representing Pascal’s Triangle.
- Use for and while loops to iterate through sequences. Nested loops may be necessary for generating each row and calculating the values of Pascal’s Triangle.
- Apply if, elif, and else conditions to implement logic based on the position within Pascal’s Triangle (e.g., the edges of the triangle always being 1).
- Understand recursion and how it can provide an alternative approach to generating Pascal’s Triangle. Recognize base cases and recursive cases for a function that generates the triangle’s rows.
- Perform addition, a fundamental operation for calculating each element of Pascal’s Triangle as the sum of the two elements directly above it.
- Access elements and slices of lists, crucial for identifying and summing the correct elements when constructing each row of the triangle.
- Be mindful of how lists are stored and copied, especially when creating new rows based on the values of the previous row.
- Use try-except blocks as needed to handle potential errors, such as invalid input types or values.
- Consider the time and space complexity of different approaches to generating Pascal’s Triangle. Evaluate and apply optimizations to improve the performance of the solution.
