# 0x0A. Prime Game

This project is part of the Alx - SE curriculum of software engineering. The primary goal is to implement a game where players take turns selecting prime numbers and removing them along with their multiples. The challenge is to determine the winner of each round, assuming optimal play by both players.

## Learning Objectives

- **Prime Numbers**:

  - Understand the definition and properties of prime numbers.
  - Learn efficient algorithms to identify prime numbers within a given range.

- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**:

  - Implement and use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a specified limit.
  - Recognize its efficiency for generating a list of primes required for solving the game.

- **Game Theory**:

  - Comprehend the basic principles of competitive games, focusing on turn-based play.
  - Analyze optimal play strategies and determine win conditions in a turn-based game setting.

- **Dynamic Programming/Memoization**:

  - Use dynamic programming or memoization techniques to optimize the solution, particularly for handling multiple rounds efficiently.
  - Understand how storing previous results can enhance performance and reduce computation time.

- **Python Programming**:
  - Utilize loops and conditional statements to implement the game logic and algorithms.
  - Manage arrays and lists to store integers, track removed numbers, and determine game outcomes.
