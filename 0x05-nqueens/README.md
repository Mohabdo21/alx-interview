# 0x05. N Queens

This project is part of the Algorithm Python curriculum. The goal is to solve the classic N Queens problem using backtracking algorithms in Python.

## Concepts Needed:

- **Backtracking Algorithms**: Understand how to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.
- **Recursion**: Implement backtracking algorithms using recursive functions.
- **List Manipulations in Python**: Create and manipulate lists to store the positions of queens on the board.
- **Python Command Line Arguments**: Handle command-line arguments with the sys module.
